# sketch2profile
####Make profiles from your 2d sketch.

the project is used for generating the area from the sketch.

Now the sketch curve only supports `line` and `arc`. 
Bezier curve may be added further.


the main algorithm is to calculate the intersection of curves ,
break the `LINE` and `ARC` and build the profile.
